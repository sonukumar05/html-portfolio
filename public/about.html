<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sonu Kumar and I'm 23 years old. I am a software engineer with a strong passion for programming and technology. I graduated from Gandhi Engineering College, where I gained a solid foundation in computer science and programming languages such as C++, JAVA, Python, and web development.</p>

<p>Currently, I reside in Bhubaneswar, but my hometown is Deoghar. As a software engineer, I am always looking to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest technology trends. Currently, I'm learning about artificial intelligence and machine learning, which I find very exciting.</p>

<p>Although I do not have any professional experience yet, I have worked on several personal projects to improve my skills and gain more practical knowledge. In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new programming languages and technologies and experimenting with different coding projects.
  I'm excited about the possibilities that software engineering holds and I'm looking forward to using my skills to create innovative and useful applications in the future.</p>
